# Developer bundle for Keda and Http-Add-on

This Porter bundle installs Keda and the Keda Http add on into the Kubernetes cluster pointed at by the kubeconfig credential. 

It also uninstalls the same packages. Both installations use Helm, in this case the bundle uses the Helm3 mixin my MChorfa. Building it locally requires adding that mixin: 

> porter mixins install helm3 --url https://github.com/mchorfa/porter-helm3/releases/download --version v0.1.12

The bundle repository https://github.com/squillace-io/keda-http also has a GH action workflow that requires a secrets.GHCR_PASSWORD to be created if you want to start automating your bundles, and the action will modify the bundle registry and tag with your org/repo and also add the Git commit to the tag.

This is the porter manifest. See https://porter.sh/author-bundles/ for 
details on every field and how to configure your bundle. This is a required
file.

## Dockerfile.tmpl

Currently, the Dockerfile.tmpl is used to clone and install the helm chart for keda-http. In the future, this step will be removed.

## .gitignore

This is a default file that we provide to help remind you which files are
generated by Porter, and shouldn't be committed to source control. You can
delete it if you don't need it.

## .dockerignore

This is a default file that controls which files are copied into the bundle's
